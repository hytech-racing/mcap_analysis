- analysis goals:



yaw_pid analysis:

- [ ] keep track of available configuration 
- [ ] controller error over time correlated with controller config
- [ ] torque differences over time vs current yaw rate

tcs / launch analysis:

- [ ] keep track of available configuration 
    - important configurations:
        - tcs PID vals
        - 
- [ ] 


- processing TODO:
- [ ] get important data from mcaps
    - [ ] filter based on when MCU mode is in RTD
